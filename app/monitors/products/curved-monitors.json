      "question": "Why isn't the LG 32MR50C-B Curved Monitor the winner?",
      "answer": "Despite the LG 32MR50C-B Curved Monitor being popular, our verification found: Despite its large 32-inch display, the FHD 1080p resolution results in severe pixelation, failing to deliver the vivid clarity claimed for work or streaming. This low pixel density is substandard for modern monitors. We only recommend products with verified specifications that match their marketing claims."
